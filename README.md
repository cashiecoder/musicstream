# musicstream
musicstream is a tool to let you save a list of songs playing on Apple Music Radio.
# How to use
To use musicstream download both the support.scpt and the musicstream.sh files and put them in a folder on your Desktop titled "musicstream" (no caps, no quotes). Then open a new Terminal window (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and run:

    cd ~/Desktop/musicstream; sh musicstream.sh

This will start saving the stream. 
# IMPORTANT
When you wish to stop the save stream, type Control+C (press C while holding down the control key). If you simply close the window, it will not save properly.
